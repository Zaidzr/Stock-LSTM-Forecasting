## ⚙️ Usage Instructions

### 👨‍💻 Running the Application
After installing the application, follow these steps to start predicting stock prices.

1. Open the application as you would any other program on your computer.
2. Select the stock symbol you want to analyze. For example, input "AAPL" for Apple Inc.
3. Adjust any parameters as needed (e.g., prediction range, input features).
4. Click the "Start Prediction" button.

### 📈 Viewing Results
Once the prediction completes, you'll see graphs showing:
- Predicted stock prices.
- Actual prices.
- Training loss over epochs.

Refer to the provided documentation for detailed explanations of each graph.

## 📊 Visualization
The application provides informative visualizations. These will help you quickly gauge:
- The effectiveness of the prediction model.
- Trends in past prices.
- How well your model performed against actual values.

You can save these graphs for reports or personal insights.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ❗ Issue: Installation Fails
- Ensure you have adequate permissions to install software on your device.
- Check that your system meets the software requirements listed above.

### ❗ Issue: Model Not Producing Results
